# letterdraw
A tiny mobile-web app for drawing letters to spell words.

Made for someone who had suffered a stroke, via this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/berkun/status/1103092770716020736

Derived from this gist: https://gist.github.com/rjrodger/1011032 (thank you to @rjrodger) with a timer and progress bar added by @trisweb.

**Note: only works on mobile devices.**
